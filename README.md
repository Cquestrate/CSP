Heating lime to 1>000 C with concentrated solar is an opportunity to generate energy both from the hot CO2
and from the heat stored in the calcium carbonate. This project aims at optimizing energy production.

At temperatures of 1000 C, deriving electricity directly through steam turbines should not be a difficult
problem, and since it doesn't involve oxygen, may actually involve less wear and tear through oxidation
compared to other sources of heat in heat exchangers.

Concentrated solar has already seen quite a lot of work on the problem of storage, with molten salt an
apparent winner for thermal buffering. Lime has a far higher melting point than salt, however, so
some issues arise with this proposal. A possible solution is to pump solar-melted salt through a
lime mixture, both transferring the heat to the lime and forcing CO2 from the lime. The lime will
require replacement as its CO2-generating potential is exhausted, and most of the mechanical complexity
will undoubtedly relate to how to perform the replacement economically.

This repo is to contain simulation model code for the proposed design.
